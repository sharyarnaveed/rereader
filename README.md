# 📚 ReReader - A Community-Powered Platform for Used School Books

**ReReader** is a full-stack platform that empowers parents and students to exchange, buy, or donate used school books. Whether you're looking to pass on books your child has outgrown or find affordable resources for the new school year, ReReader makes it simple, social, and sustainable.

## 🎯 Core Concept

ReReader is a user-friendly platform where:
- Parents can **list** used books for sale or donation.
- Others can **buy** them at a low price or request them **for free** if marked as a donation.

## 🔥 Unique Angles To Make It Stand Out

- 💝 **Donation Support**: Let users list books as donations, helping families in real need.
- 🏅 **Recognition System**: Users who frequently donate books earn badges like `BookHero`.
- 📚 **Wishlist System**: Students/parents can add books to a wishlist and get notified when a match is found.
